Hi,

==>This website is a copy of the YouTube homepage.

==>If you resize the web page then the website will also resize itself so that it can fit your screen.

==>This website is purely based on HTML and CSS.

==>You can also type anything in the search bar at the top of the website.

==>There is also a tooltip when you click the button with a magnifying glass next to the search bar.

==> I have also added Shadow inside the search bar.

==> When you hover over the left-side panel buttons they will change their color.

==>If you click any video on the page then it will redirect you to that specific video on youtube.com.

==>This was made by me without any help from social media.

==>When you point at any button, you can see the pointer will change to hand.

==>If you resize the web page then the thumbnail will also resize itself so that it can fit your screen.

==> I can also add shadows and transitions to the buttons. For a better experience open it on a laptop or pc.
